# Straight word order
#The rule aims to rearrange the words in a sentence to achieve
#straight word order. That is, first a subject, then a verb, and
#then an object.
#For straight word order, sentences indicating reversed word order were matched. That is, sentences where the first word is an adverb and the second word is a verb.
